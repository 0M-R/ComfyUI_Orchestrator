Transfer the graphic design from image2 onto the main visible surface of the upper garment worn by the person in image1.

Keep the person, body shape, pose, lighting, background, garment type, and garment color unchanged.

Center the design on the largest visible flat area of the garment. The print should cover approximately 55–65% of the visible garment area and be proportionally scaled to fit naturally within the clothing boundaries.

The design must follow fabric folds, perspective, lighting, and contours realistically, appearing as a high-quality professional print applied to the garment.
